## How To Play
The aim of Pac-Man is to eat all the pills to advance to the next level, without being caught by the ghosts.

If Pac-Man eats a super pill the ghosts will turn frightened and Pac-Man will be able to eat them to gain bonus points. Otherwise, if Pac-Man encounters a ghost he will lose a life.

Pac-Man can also gain bonus points by eating the bonus fruit which appears randomly in the maze once a certain amount of pills have been eaten.
